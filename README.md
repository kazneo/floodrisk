### Abstract
Our project aims to predict flooding fractions in the critical medical infrastructure locations in the southeastern coastal areas USA using an integrated database of explanatory variables and machine learning algorithms. First, data related to flooding are obtained and merged, including topographic data, precipitation, storm tide, water surface level, soil moisture, etc. Five regression, namely: Random Forest, XGBoosting, KNN, SVR, and Multivariate Regression algorithms are utilized to predict the flooding fraction and evaluated on the dataset. The accuracy of the models is assessed by statistical metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RMSE. Finally, as case studies, the developed prediction model was combined with a vulnerability model and evaluated the flooding risk in the southeastern coastal regions considering socioeconomic factors and community resilience. The near real-time flooding risk map was developed on our GitHub website (https://github.com/ITWSXInformatics/Flood_Warning_IS_Group5_2023). This model can be a basis for developing a Flooding Risk Information System for supporting decision-making to manage flooding hazards and prevent flooding damage in advance. 

#### Problem 
Medical facilities, including hospitals, urgent care centers, veterans health administration medical facilities, and dialysis centers, are critical infrastructure to provide communities with health services; however, natural hazards, especially flooding, can cause severe damage and temporary shutdowns of them, and it precludes first-aid patients from receiving urgent medical services.

#### Goal 
This project aims to develop a prediction model for flooding fractions in critical medical infrastructure locations in the Southeastern USA using the integrated database of explanatory variables and machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, we aim to develop a near real-time flooding risk map based on the proposed prediction model.
